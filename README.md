# XtremeRC
A website made for Xtreme RC in Ladson, SC.

During my first year at Trident Tech we had a project that required us to make a website for a client. 
We had the option of creating a fake client, but I wanted to add real-world experience to the project 
and sought out a business in need of a website. I stumbled upon a family-owned RC hobby shop in Ladson, SC.
I interviewed them to find out more about the shop and products, took pictures, and formed an idea of what they wanted.

The website is a simple responsive website that displays information on a handful of their products. Information is also given 
of other services they offer: repairs, birthday parties, racing events, rentals, upgrades, etc.
